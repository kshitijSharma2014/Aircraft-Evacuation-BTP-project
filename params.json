{"name":"Aircraft Evacuation Simulation","tagline":"Fuzzy Systems","body":"### About Project\r\nThe effectiveness of Aircraft Evacuation plays a vital role in the safety of the passengers on board. Our motive is to create a multi-agent simulator, which would enable the aircraft manufacturers to test the evacuation process of the aircraft. Our model is based on cellular automata where the bi-dimensional grids represents the aircraft structure and an agent which control the passengers to evacuate the aircraft . Each agent is characterized by the properties of a human. An agent has properties like age, motion, sex, response time, position and status. Each cell in the grid represents a capacity, which is occupied by the agent i.e. the passenger. The application of this model is at the time of emergency evacuation of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@kshitijSharma2014\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nKshitij Sharma at Ksh.anand2012@gmail.com <br />\r\nProf. Bhaskar Chaudhury: https://goo.gl/WyGeAk","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
