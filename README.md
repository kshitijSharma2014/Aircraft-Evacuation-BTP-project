# Aircraft-Evacuation-BTP-project
The potential of Aircraft Evacuation plays a vital role in the safety of the passengers on board. Our motive is to create a multi-agent simulator, which would enable the aircraft manufacturers to test the evacuation process of the aircraft. The model is based on a cellular automaton and implemented using cuda C language. An agent can have properties like motion, sex, response time, position and status.
